# PwC_Python

Welcome to our Project made with the help of API System. Thanks to PredictHQ events API  and MAPBox for providing such a brilliant api solution. 

Objective: The main purpose of making this project is to search the event organized by various parties in UAE. 

Working Model: 

To run the code we need to run the PwC.py. Then we need to open the address provided by the server i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
Then we need to click anywhere on the screen(outside the map region) for the code to start working. We can alter any of the checkpoints and the corresponding graph will be displayed soon after the page is updated. Clicking on any of the icons will provide its description at the bootom of the page on the desription box.


Thanks
Ashish Kumar Jha
